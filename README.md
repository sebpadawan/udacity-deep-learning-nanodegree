# Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree


Introduction
---

This repo contains all the codes I have worked on during my Udacity Nanodegree about **deep learning**. This nanodegree is composed of one term of 4 months. More details about this nanodegree can be found [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) (in its new version, the deep reinforcement learning has been removed and is studied in [another nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893), but was present at the time the course was taken).

This Deep Learning Nanodegree program offers a solid introduction to the world of artificial intelligence. In this program, we study fundamentals to go further in the field. We study cutting-edge topics such as Neural Networks, ConvolutionalNeural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Generative Adversarial Networks, Deep reinforcement learning using numpy, tensorflow and Keras. We learn from authorities such Ian Goodfellow and Jun-YanZhu, inventors of types of generative adversarial networks, as well as AI experts, Sebastian Thrun and Andrew Trask.

| Project | Folder | Description | Language |
| :------:| :------:| :------:| :------:|
| Predicting bike-sharing price | [DeepND-neural-network-from-scratch](./DeepND-neural-network-from-scratch) | Build and train neural networks from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day. | Python (Numpy)|
| Dog-breed classifier | [DeepND-dog-classifier](./DeepND-dog-classifier) | Design and train a convolutional neural network to analyze images of dogs and correctly identify their breeds. Use transfer learning and well-known architectures to improve this modelâ€”this is excellent preparation for more advanced applications. | Python (Tensorflow) |
| TV-script generation | [DeepND-tv-script-generation](./DeepND-tv-script-generation) | Build a recurrent neural network on TensorFlow to process text. Use it to generate new episodes of your favorite TV show, based on old scripts.. | Python (Tensorflow) |
| Face generation| [DeepND-face-generation-with-generative-adversarial-network](./DeepND-face-generation-with-generative-adversarial-network) | Build a pair of multi-layer neural networks and make them compete against each other in order to generate new, realistic faces. Try training them on a set of celebrity faces, and see what new faces the computer comes out with! | Python (Tensorflow) |
| Quadcopter flying | [DeepND-quadcopter-with-deep-reinforcement-learning](./DeepND-quadcopter-with-deep-reinforcement-learning) | Use Reinforcement Learning algorithms like Q-Learning to train artificial agents to take optimal actions in an environment. | Python (Keras) |
